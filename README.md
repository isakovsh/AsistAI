# AsistAi Chatbot

AsistAi is an AI-powered chatbot created using Langchain and implemented with Streamlit. It aims to eliminate queues at the call operator and provide an easy and fast chatbot solution for any business.

## Project Description

In today's fast-paced world, customers expect quick and efficient service from businesses. Waiting in long queues to reach a call operator can be frustrating and time-consuming. AsistAi is designed to revolutionize customer support by providing an AI-powered chatbot solution.

By leveraging the power of Langchain, AsistAi understands natural language queries and responds with accurate and helpful information. This eliminates the need for customers to wait in queues and allows businesses to handle customer queries more efficiently.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources such as online forums, websites, and existing customer support logs. The data collected should cover a wide range of customer queries and possible responses.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess and clean the collected data to ensure it is suitable for training the chatbot. This step may involve removing irrelevant information, formatting the data, and handling missing values.

3. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the cleaned data to gain insights and identify patterns that can improve the chatbot's performance. This analysis helps in identifying frequent customer queries, common issues, and appropriate responses.

4. **AI Model Creation**: Build an AI model using Langchain to train the chatbot. Train the model using the cleaned data to enable the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries effectively. Continuously refine and optimize the model to improve its accuracy and performance.

5. **Project MVP with Streamlit**: Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the chatbot using the Streamlit framework. Streamlit allows for easy development and deployment of web-based applications. Implement a user-friendly interface where customers can interact with the chatbot and get quick responses to their queries.

## Usage

### For Businesses

AsistAi provides the following benefits for businesses:

- **Improved Customer Support**: Businesses can offer instant and accurate responses to customer queries, reducing the need for customers to wait in queues and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

- **24/7 Availability**: AsistAi is available round the clock, allowing businesses to provide support to their customers at any time, even outside regular business hours.

- **Efficiency and Cost Savings**: By automating responses to common customer queries, businesses can free up call operators' time, reduce call volumes, and lower operational costs.

### For Developers

Developers can access AsistAi's API to integrate the chatbot into their own applications or services. The API provides programmatic access to the chatbot's functionality, allowing developers to leverage its capabilities and provide a seamless chatbot experience within their applications.
